# Segment of the Moment: Learning Objectives

One of the important data analytics tasks that a marketing firm/specialists will undertake is performing a customer segmentation analysis. The goal of customer segmentation is to divide the customer base into groups such that each group consists of similar members and there are distinct groups that together comprise the customer database.

Essentially, you are trying to understand who is buying your products and is there anything common among some subsets of your customers. If you find 2 or more subsets that differ from each other but seem to show some common behavior within their own groups, you are arriving at customer segments. By going through this case and the accompanying code, you will be taking a first pass at performing a customer segmentation task.


# MiddleOfEverywhere Resale Inc.

In this case, you are hired as a Business Analyst by a midwestern wholesale firm - MiddleOfEveryWhere Resale Inc, which of specializes in stocking and selling grocery (some perishable) and non-perishable products. This firm has numerous agreements with retailers and resellers from the neighboring districts. As a wholesale firm, you mainly stock  popular brands of rice/grains, chocolate, and alcoholic drinks. In the non-food category, you stock popular paper products, clothing items such as T-shirts and sportswear, and convenience-oriented electronic goods. While you know that there are many retailers who buy from you, there are also local agents (resellers) that seem to buy these products from you. 

Your sales team is finding it difficult to come up with promotions and advertising targeting specific customer groups since they lack passed-down wisdom about the different types of customers they serve. They have been able to compile clean aggregate sales data but they seek your advise on the next steps. 



# Learning Objective
